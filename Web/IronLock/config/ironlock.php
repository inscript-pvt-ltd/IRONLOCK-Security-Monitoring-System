    | Window rules for guard check-in (login) and shift start, in minutes
    | either side of the shift's scheduled_start. A single value drives both
    | the "too early" floor (start − window) and the "too late" ceiling
    | (start + window), so changing it here moves both edges together.
    |
    | - check_in_window_minutes: a guard may sign in / check in from
    |   scheduled_start − N until scheduled_start + N, and may press Start up
    |   to scheduled_start + N. Past that the shift is Missed.
    |
    | - late_authorization_minutes: when a supervisor authorizes a late
    |   check-in on a Missed shift, the per-shift override stays open for this
    |   many minutes from the moment it is granted.
